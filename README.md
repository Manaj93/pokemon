# Pokémon

A 2D Pokémon-style browser game built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Tiled.

- Smooth player movement and collision detection
- Foreground and background layers for visual depth
- Modular class structure for sprites and boundaries

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- HTML5 Canvas
- Vanilla JavaScript
- CSS
- Tiled

## 🚀 How to Run

   cd pokemon
   ```

2. Open `index.html` in your browser.

## 📝 To-Dos

- Fix player sprite spacing: remove extra transparent padding around player image
- Ensure all image assets are fully loaded before calling `animate()`
- Refactor repetitive collision logic into a reusable helper function
- Add walking animation frames for player movement
- Add NPCs or interactive objects with basic collision and dialogue triggers
- Implement map transitions (e.g., entering buildings or changing zones)
- Add sound effects and background music for immersion
- Create a loading screen or splash intro before gameplay starts
- Optimize performance for larger maps and multiple layers
- Add support for multiple player directions (left, right, up) with corresponding sprites
